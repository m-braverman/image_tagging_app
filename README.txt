Tagging App
-----------

1. Place your photo files in ./public/photos
2. To run the app run 'node index.js' in the app folder (tagapp).
3. After tagging is done, shutdown the server (Ctrl-C), and run it
 again using 'node index.js' for database compression.
4. Shut it down again (Ctrl-C).
5. You can now extract the tagging results. They are in data/photos (a json file).

To re-run the app: remove data/photos and data/users, and go to step 2.


Happy Tagging!
